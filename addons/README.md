# KWC Auto Key Create Addon

This script is a small script to automate the [`kwc.py`](https://github.com/NSIS-arch/KWC) script.

# How to use

(Delete the # sign in front of the operating system you are using from the [`kwc_auto_script.py`]() file when getting started)

<p1>First move or copy the script file next to the `kwc.py` file.Then open your console and type these commands:</p1>

```
$ python kwc_auto_script.py
```
* Take care to run the files you download in the folders they are in.

# Ease of Use

With this little addon you don't need to compile the [`kwc.py`](https://github.com/NSIS-arch/KWC) script. You can compile and use this script if you want (provided you don't compile the [`kwc.py`](https://github.com/NSIS-arch/KWC) script). Its ease of use is that it generates a key each time you run the `kwc` script. Thanks to this script, you can use the `kwc` script as a `wordlist generator` if you want.(To compile this file, you can use the pyinstaller you downloaded before to [`compile the kwc script`](https://github.com/NSIS-arch/KWC#another-usage).)
